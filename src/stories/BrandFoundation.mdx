#### Battle-tested in Enterprise Apps

Xandr is an internet technology company that uses data and machine learning to power the world’s open digital audience platforms.
React is a core part of our front-end architecture and our components have to be able to handle large data sets and complex workflows.
We take great care in designing components that are easy-to-use and flexible enough to handle unique configurations.
We continuously create new components and refine existing ones with feedback from our own suite of enterprise React apps and the open source community.

#### Hybrid Component State

All components manage their own internal state by default, however any prop passed in explicitly will always override the internal value.
This allows developers to control important app state in a store while letting the component manage the more mundane component state automatically.
We accomplish this by developing all of our components as pure, stateless components along with a set of reducer functions to control behavior.
The stateless component and the reducers are combined to create the final component that manages its own state.

#### Child Component Composition

Developers of large, complex components will often conceal complexity by exposing a multitude of various props to provide custom configurations.
Kayana exposes child components that are passed in as children rather having to rely on passing in elements, components or render functions via props.
The resulting code is clean, flexible JSX that embraces component composition.

```

#### Computed Props With `reselect`

Some components need to calculate values in every render, and in many cases, these computations will return the same values repeatedly.
In these instances, we use `reselect` to cache results providing a performance boost in those components.

<p key='link2computed'>

		computed props
	</LinkTo>
	.
</p>
```

#### Human-readable CSS Class Names

All components follow a strict, consistent pattern for CSS class names. This is because we consider CSS classes as part of our public API.
It also makes it easy to target specific elements for custom styling and functional tests.
